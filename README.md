# Face-Mask-Spotter-Software
My name is Amitesh Kumar Singh and my team partner is Chirag Jain
Our team name is ERROR 404 !!

As we all are aware about the covid .as same there may be new type of disrease in future like direct spreading disease 
 face mask spotting setupThe corona virus COVID-19 pandemic is causing a
global health crisis so the effective protection methods is
wearing a face mask in public areas according to the World
Health Organization (WHO)

A hybrid model using deep and classical machine learning for face mask detection will be presented. A face mask detection dataset consists of with mask and without mask images , we are going to use OpenCV to do real-time face detection from a live stream via our webcam. We will use the dataset to build a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision using Python, OpenCV, and Tensor Flow and Keras
